# Ghost Hunters

## Game Microservices â€“ Service Boundaries

This project is built using a **microservices architecture** to ensure modularity, scalability, and independent deployment of each component. Each service is implemented in a language chosen to best fit its specific responsibilities, allowing the team to leverage **polyglot programming** for optimal performance and maintainability.

We selected **JavaScript (Node.js)**, **C# (.NET)**, and **Python** for this project:  
- **JavaScript (Node.js)** is used for services requiring high concurrency and fast development cycles, such as user management and ghost AI. Its event-driven model and rich ecosystem make it ideal for real-time operations and rapid prototyping.  
- **C# (.NET)** is used for services that demand strong type safety, reliability, and transactional consistency, such as Shop and Journal. It provides excellent performance under load and robust tooling for enterprise-grade APIs.  
- **Python** is chosen for services that benefit from flexibility, simplicity, and fast iteration, such as Lobby and Map. Its async capabilities and mature libraries allow efficient handling of multiple game sessions and dynamic content management.

This combination of technologies allows us to **balance speed of development, runtime performance, and maintainability**, ensuring each service meets the unique demands of the game while allowing teams to work efficiently within their expertise.

# Ghost Hunters â€“ Technologies and Communication Patterns

This project follows a **polyglot microservices architecture** to ensure modularity, scalability, and independence of each team.  
Each microservice is implemented in a language and technology stack that best matches its business logic and performance requirements.  
Services communicate via **REST APIs** for synchronous operations and **message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ/Kafka)** for asynchronous updates.

---

## 1. User Management Service (JavaScript / Node.js)

### Technologies:
- **Node.js + Express** for REST APIs.
- **MongoDB** for user and friend data (flexible schema for social graph).
- **JWT** for authentication and authorization.
- **Redis** for caching sessions and currency balances.

### Communication Patterns:
- **REST API** for CRUD operations on users and friends.
- **Event publishing** (via Kafka) when currency updates or new friends are added (consumed by Inventory and Lobby services).

### Motivation & Trade-offs:
- **Pros:** Node.js handles concurrent HTTP requests efficiently, rich ecosystem for auth (Passport.js, JWT).  
- **Cons:** Single-threaded, CPU-heavy tasks (hashing) need offloading to worker threads.  
- **Fit:** Ideal for high-volume user interactions and real-time friend updates.

---

## 2. Ghost AI Service (JavaScript / Node.js)

### Technologies:
- **Node.js** with **Worker Threads** or **Cluster** for running ghost AI as independent actors.
- **Socket.IO (WebSockets)** for real-time updates to the Game Service.
- **In-memory state store** (Redis) for ghost decisions.

### Communication Patterns:
- **Event-driven**: broadcasts ghost state changes (hiding, haunting, attacking) to the Game Service.  
- **REST API** for debug tools and querying ghost states.

### Motivation & Trade-offs:
- **Pros:** Event-driven model + WebSockets are perfect for real-time AI-driven interactions.  
- **Cons:** Node.js is weaker in CPU-heavy computations; may require scaling ghost workers horizontally.  
- **Fit:** Excellent for fast iteration on ghost logic and broadcasting AI state changes in real time.

---

## 3. Shop Service (C# / .NET 7)

### Technologies:
- **ASP.NET Core Web API** for catalog endpoints.
- **SQL Server** for item and price history persistence.
- **Entity Framework Core** for ORM.
- **gRPC** for efficient communication with Inventory Service.

### Communication Patterns:
- **REST API** for item catalog queries from players.  
- **gRPC** for low-latency communication with Inventory Service (price validation).  
- **Event publishing** (via RabbitMQ) when prices change, consumed by Game Service.

### Motivation & Trade-offs:
- **Pros:** .NET provides high performance, strong typing, and enterprise-level tooling.  
- **Cons:** More heavy-weight than scripting languages; slower prototyping.  
- **Fit:** Perfect for financial transactions and historical price tracking where consistency is critical.

---

## 4. Journal Service (C# / .NET 7)

### Technologies:
- **ASP.NET Core Web API** for CRUD journal entries.
- **SQL Server** for storing session-based journal records.
- **Entity Framework Core** for data modeling.
- **Background workers** for validating journal results at session end.

### Communication Patterns:
- **REST API** for players to submit and query journals.  
- **Async messaging** with User Management Service to award currency after validation.  
- **REST/gRPC** with Game Service to fetch actual ghost type for comparison.

### Motivation & Trade-offs:
- **Pros:** Strong consistency model, robust schema for structured journal entries.  
- **Cons:** More complex setup compared to Python/JS.  
- **Fit:** Reliable choice for validation-heavy workflows where correctness matters (awarding rewards).

---

## 5. Lobby Service (Python / FastAPI)

### Technologies:
- **FastAPI** for high-performance async REST APIs.
- **PostgreSQL** for session state (players, sanity, items, ghosts, maps).
- **SQLAlchemy** for ORM.
- **Celery + Redis** for background session cleanup tasks.

### Communication Patterns:
- **REST API** for creating and managing lobbies.  
- **Event-driven messaging** (via Kafka) to sync state with Ghost AI and User Management services.  
- **WebSockets** for real-time lobby updates to clients.

### Motivation & Trade-offs:
- **Pros:** Pythonâ€™s FastAPI is very fast to develop, async support is strong for managing multiple lobbies.  
- **Cons:** Slower raw performance vs C#/Go; needs scaling under heavy load.  
- **Fit:** Great for coordinating state across multiple players in a lobby.

---

## 6. Map Service (Python / FastAPI)

### Technologies:
- **FastAPI** for REST APIs managing maps.
- **PostgreSQL** (JSONB) for flexible map storage (rooms, objects, hiding places).
- **Pydantic** for schema validation of user-created maps.

### Communication Patterns:
- **REST API** for CRUD operations on maps.  
- **Event publishing** when new maps are created (consumed by Lobby and Ghost AI).  
- **Read-only API** consumed by Game Service to load maps.

### Motivation & Trade-offs:
- **Pros:** Python is excellent for handling JSON-like structures; very flexible for user-generated content.  
- **Cons:** Handling large map computations may need optimization or caching.  
- **Fit:** Perfect for CRUD-heavy, content-driven service where flexibility matters more than raw speed.

---

## 7. Ghost Service

### Technologies:
- **Node.js (Express / Fastify)** for REST API endpoints and service logic.
- **PostgreSQL** (or any relational DB) to store ghost types and symptoms.
- **Redis** (optional) for caching frequently accessed ghost data.
- **Worker threads / Bull (Queue)** for batch updates or complex ghost behavior processing.

### Communication Patterns:
- **REST API** for retrieving ghost types and symptoms.
- **Event-driven (Message Queue, e.g., Kafka/RabbitMQ)** for notifying Lobby or Game Service about ghost updates or new ghost additions.

### Motivation & Trade-offs:
- **Pros:** Node.js provides fast I/O, easy JSON handling, and event-driven concurrency for multiple requests.  
- **Cons:** CPU-intensive tasks (complex ghost AI logic) may block the event loop; requires worker threads or separate services for heavy computations.

---

## 8. Location Service

### Technologies:
- **Node.js (Express / Fastify)** for REST API endpoints.
- **Redis** for fast in-memory storage of player locations and real-time state.

- **WebSockets (Socket.IO)** for real-time broadcasting of player locations.
- **Bull / Queue workers** for background tasks such as cleanup or aggregation.

### Communication Patterns:
- **REST API** for querying player positions and state.
- **WebSockets** for real-time broadcasting of location updates to Lobby and Ghost AI.
- **Event-driven (Message Queue)** for notifying other services when player location changes trigger game events.

### Motivation & Trade-offs:
- **Pros:** Node.js + Redis + WebSockets allows efficient real-time tracking. Flexible and easy to maintain schema for dynamic player state.  
- **Cons:** High-frequency updates can stress the event loop; requires scaling horizontally or using worker threads for heavy workloads.

# GitHub Workflow

To ensure consistency and maintain high-quality contributions, we follow a structured workflow in this project.  
This section describes how branching, merging, reviews, and versioning are handled.

---

## 1. Branching Strategy

We use two primary branches:

- **`main`** â†’ Stable production-ready branch.  
- **`dev`** â†’ Integration branch where features are merged before release.

### Branch Naming Convention

- **Feature branches:** `feature/<short-description>`  
  - Example: `feature/user-authentication`
- **Bugfix branches:** `bugfix/<issue-number>-<short-description>`  
  - Example: `bugfix/123-fix-lobby-crash`
- **Hotfix branches (critical fixes to main):** `hotfix/<short-description>`  
  - Example: `hotfix/fix-login-token`

---

## 2. Merging Strategy

- All changes must be proposed via **Pull Requests (PRs)** into the `development` branch.  
- PRs into `main` happen only from `development` once a release is ready.  
- **Fast-forward merges are not allowed** â†’ We use **Squash and Merge** for clean history.  

---

## 3. Pull Requests (PRs)

Each PR must include:

- **Title** â†’ Clear and descriptive (e.g., `Add Ghost AI decision-making module`)  
- **Description** â†’ What was done, why, and how it was tested.  
- **Linked Issues** â†’ Reference issues with `Closes #issueNumber`.  
- **Checklist**:
  - [ ] Code compiles successfully  
  - [ ] Tests are written/updated  
  - [ ] Documentation updated (if needed)  

---

## 4. Code Reviews & Approvals

- At least **2 approvals** are required for merging a PR.  
- **Self-approval is not allowed**.  
- **Requested changes must be resolved** before merging.  

---

## 5. Test Coverage

- All new features must include **unit and integration tests**.  
- Minimum **80% coverage** enforced via CI (GitHub Actions).  
- Tests are run automatically on each PR.  

---

## 6. Versioning

- We follow **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**:  
  - **MAJOR** version â†’ Incompatible API changes  
  - **MINOR** version â†’ Backward-compatible new features  
  - **PATCH** version â†’ Backward-compatible bug fixes  

Example: `v2.1.4` â†’ Major release 2, minor update 1, patch 4.  

---

## 7. Continuous Integration / Deployment (CI/CD)

- **CI** runs on every PR â†’ Builds, runs tests, checks coverage.  
- **CD** is triggered from `main` â†’ Deploys stable release.  

---

## 8. Release Workflow

1. Work is merged into `development`.  
2. Once stable â†’ Create a **release branch**: `release/x.y.z`.  
3. Test and validate â†’ Merge into `main`.  
4. Tag release with version number.  
5. Deploy automatically via GitHub Actions.
